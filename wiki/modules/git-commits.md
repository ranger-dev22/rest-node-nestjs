# Git commits and pre hooks

We have added some git pre hooks while committing the code. These pre hooks are executed on every git commit.

Commit message can be bifurcated into 3 section "<Type>(<Module>): <Commit_Message>"

Type: can be anyone of them feat | bugfix | feature etc.

Module: Module is the name of the module you are working on 

Commit_Message: Actual commit message

``` git commit -m "feat(documentation): Adding documentation" ```
